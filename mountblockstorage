How to partition, format, and mount your block storage

Setting up your block storage is quick and easy. Here are the steps to follow in Linux such as Debian/Ubuntu

    SSH into your server and use the command lsblk to check the name of the added block storage. It will typically be listed as /dev/vdb.

    Install parted if not already installed, using apt install parted

    Execute the following sequence of CLI commands

    parted /dev/vdb
    mklabel gpt
    mkpart primary 0% 100%
    quit
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb1 <- This takes a while depending on the size of your storage. Be patient.

    Create a folder where you want the new partition mounted using the command mkdir /mnt/hdd (can name it what you want).

    Use the command mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt/hdd to mount the new partition.

    run the following CLI command to automatically mount the partition at boot echo "/dev/vdb1 /mnt/hdd ext4 defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
    Verify the new partition is properly mounted by using the command df -h. This should show /dev/vdb1 and it's size mounted to /hdd

That's it! Enjoy your new persistent large storage space.


echo "/dev/vdb1 /home/master/torrents/qbittorrent ext4 defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

mount /dev/vdb1 /home/master/torrents/qbittorrent
